Question 1) Approximately how long into the simulation (seconds) is the DNS
            reflection attack detected? How can you tell this from the DNS
            response rate plot?

Answer 1) Approximately after 25 seconds after starting the monitor. We can estimate this by
          looking for the point in the graph in which the number of DNS replies received by H2
          starts to decrease until it goes back to normal levels (compared to H3). This reduction
          in the rate of DNS responses received by H2 indicates that monitor has installed
          the rule to drop DNS replies from H1 that do not have a corresponding request.

Question 2) What components of the detection/mitigation technique used in this assignment
            may not be optimal for real-world deployment? Choose one and explain how it
            could be improved.

Answer 2) A some components that might not be optimal for real world deployment are having to install
          a rule for every DNS request, having a monitor sniff all DNS packets to look for reflection
          attacks, restricting a DNS server permanently. I believe blocking that creating a rule
          to block the server from sending DNS packets to a host permanently is problematic because,
          if the attack stops, we are still going to have to deal with the overhead of installing
          a new rule for every DNS request coming from the attacked host which is bound to consume
          processing resources on the switch and network.

Question 3) DNS reflection attacks are of real concern in the global Internet,
            but a general solution that does not involve updating all connected
            hosts at once has yet to be found.

	        Think about the reasons why DNS reflection attacks are possible (e.g.,
	        what does the attacker do, what does the DNS resolver do, what causes
	        the victim to be negatively affected).

            Pick one of these reasons and brainstorm methods to prevent it, thereby
            preventing DNS reflection attacks (even if these methods require a
            complete Internet upgrade).

            Describe the reason you chose and a possible prevention method you came
            up with.

            This question is intentionally open-ended and will be graded leniently.
            Try to be concise yet thorough.
